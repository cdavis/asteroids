This was our first working game in pyglet, our own asteroids implementation based off the `old_junk/v5` example.
To run it (on windows, using windows python not wsl python) do something like:

  python3 basic.py example

The game engine in this version is called basic.py and the asteroids game module is example.py, specified here just as 'example'.
