Collision category (bitmask) / colliision_type stuff is probably broken.
Asteroids colide with Asteroids despite us not saying that should hapepn (it should, be we don't say so).

We fixed such that player does not collide with bullets...

Player does bump into asteroids but it doesnt' "collide" in the "run a collision handler" sense, so that is likely because KINEMATIC.

this is probably an ordering issue, we should update() kinematic objects FIRST each frame, then do pymunk tick of dynamic objs
this way we call reindex_shapes_for_body() right before step()
