To run the game in windows use Windows python (python3.exe) NOT the wsl python from bash.
You will need to run a command like:

  python3 game.py hydrosim

The script game.py takes a python module name as its arg and it runs the setup/init functions in that module.
To change the code, its all in hydrosim.py
